# Stackdriver Prometheus sidecar

This repository contains a sidecar for the Prometheus server that can send
metrics to Stackdriver. This is based on [this
design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TEqqE_Stq04drhjSU1I7Ctmuy0dpsvlPL1AKxqEQoSg/edit). Access
to the design document requires membership on
prometheus-developers@googlegroups.com.

## Installation

To install the sidecar on a local machine run:

```
go get github.com/Stackdriver/stackdriver-prometheus-sidecar/...
```

## Deployment

The sidecar is deployed next to an already running Prometheus server. It can stream
sample data into Stackdriver that is associated with a Kubernetes target in Prometheus.

The following information must be provided:

* `GCP_PROJECT`: The ID of the GCP project the data is written to.
* `WAL_DIR`: the `./wal` directory within Prometheus's data directory.
* `API_ADDRESS`: Prometheus's API address, typically `127.0.0.1:9090` like the default
* `REGION`: a valid GCP or AWS region with which the [Stackdriver monitored resources](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/resources) are associated. Maps to the resource's `location` label (sometimes also called `region`).
* `CLUSTER`: a custom name for the monitored Kubernetes cluster. Maps to the monitored resource's `cluster_name` label.

```
stackdriver-prometheus-sidecar \
  --stackdriver.project-id=${GCP_PROJECT} \
  --prometheus.wal-directory=${WAL_DIR}" \
  --prometheus.api-address=${API_ADDRESS} \
  --stackdriver.kubernetes.location=${REGION} \ 
  --stackdriver.kubernetes.cluster-name=${CLUSTER}
```

The sidecar requires write access to the directory to store its progress between restarts.

If your Prometheus server itself is running inside of Kubernetes, the example manifests
can be used as a reference for setup:

* [Standard deployment](./kube/prometheus-meta.yaml)
* [Deployment with the Prometheus Operator](./kube/prometheus-meta-operated.yaml)
